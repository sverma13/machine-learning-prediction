Accomplished:
[x] Created neural network of decision trees and random forests.
[x] Used RSI technical indicator as a machine learning feature.
[x] Used gradient boosting model to reduce an overfitting learning model.

Next steps:
[] Continue to use more technical indicators as features.
[] Alter parameters of gradient boosting.
[] Implement scaling and KNN (kth-nearest-neighbor) methods.
