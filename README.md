# machine-learning-prediction
Machine learning algorithm in Python that predicts a stockâ€™s future price pattern based on historical data

To view the code and results:
- Open the Jupyter notebook in Github.

To run the algorithm:
1. Go to the working directory where you want to store the Python and CSV files.
2. Download Python script and CSV file in the desired working directory.
3. Run Python script.

Comments:
- For the scatter plot of predicted prices and actual prices, data closely fitting the line y=x indicates the predictions are accurate to the actual values.
- Too high of a performance score means the model is overfitting the training data, which results in a poor prediciton of new values (test data).
